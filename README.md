## üìù Notes

Building this app helped me:  
- Gain comfort with **Kotlin basics** (`val` vs `var`)  
- Learn how to connect XML layout components to Kotlin code (`findViewById`)  
- Understand **onClickListeners** for user interaction  
- Practice updating UI dynamically with `TextView`  
- Work with **ConstraintLayout** for positioning elements  

**Challenges:**  
- Understanding how to properly set button visibility (`View.VISIBLE` vs `View.INVISIBLE`)  
- Remembering to update the UI from within the click listener  
- Getting custom button icons sized correctly in the layout
